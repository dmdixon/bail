\title{Daily Incarceration Report}
\date{<<date>>}
    
\begin{document}
    
\maketitle
This report is programically generated and contains statistical information about inmates residing in the Nashville-Davidson County area on the date of <<date>>. For convenience the report is broken in to the following sections.
    
\begin{enumerate}
\item Report Overview
\item Statistical Tables
\item Distribution Plots
\item Processing Details
\end{enumerate}
    
\section{Report Overview}
 At the time this report was generated <<Ninmates>> inmates are held in custody, with <<Pcdcmdf>>\% of them residing in the Correctional Development Center or the Metro Detention Facility. There is a total of <<Ncharges>> charges distributed amongst the inmates, yielding a median of <<medNcharges>> charges per inmate. The charges are split between <<Nmisd>> misdemeanors and <<Nfel>> felonies with a median total bond of <<medTbond>>. <<Ndrgoff>> of active inmates have a charge related to drugs and <<Nice>> of inmates are listed as  ICE detainees. In the last 48 hours <<Nrb>> people were taken into custody and <<Nrbrel>> have been released. <<dwd>>

\section{Statistical Tables}
This section lists statistical values concerning the active inmate dataset. Note these values may not take into account changes induced by recent bookings.

\end{table}
    
\section{Distribution Plots}
This section diplays distribution plots separated by Race and Sex. For visualization purposes numerical data points that are separated from the median by <<plot\_outliers>> times the median absolute deviation of a distribution were not plotted. Additionally, categorical data values with less than <<plot\_other>>\% of the the total category were added to "other."

\section{Processing Details}
The data utilized in this report was automatically compiled using a Python based web scraper to query public data available at \url{http://dcso.nashville.gov/} and \url{https://ccc.nashville.gov/}. The code for the web scraper and report is publically available through a \href{https://github.com/dmdixon/bail}{git repository}. The primary output files for the code are tables for active inmates and recent bookings. The file size for both files are <<aaifsize>> and <<rbfsize>> respectively.
